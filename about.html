            <h1>About me</h1>
                <p>My name's Fred and I'm a game developer from Portugal. Besides games, I've also dabbled in video editing and content creation. At the moment my focus is on Game Development, and I hope you enjoy what 
                I create!</p>
                <p>I grew up with all kinds of games, giving me a broad understanding of how different mechanics can be integrated with story, audio and user experience to produce great results in each genre. 
                My personal preferences include turn-based RPGs set in huge worlds (Dragon Quest VIII or XI are great examples), action games with a steep learning curve that remain fun, keeping you immersed and challenged 
                at all times (Elden Ring) and story-driven games where the cast of characters is so great that you keep playing until the end, no matter what.</p>
                <p>Games are a a very unique form of art. Their artistic elements come in many different ways; a game with a great story and simple gameplay can be as amazing as a game with little to no story and absolutely amazing
                gameplay. Understanding what you want a game to be and striving to create the best elements for it is the key to success. My dream is to work on teams for games I can be proud of, and to make my own small games of 
                a few different genres, all amazing and with their own merits.</p>
                <p>I'll update my site as time goes on, so be sure to check back regularly for new stuff. Don't forget to follow me on social media so you don't miss my upcoming streams working on my latest game, GoFast!</br>

            <h2>Top three favorite games</h2>
                <h3>Silent Hill 2</h3>
                <p>It's the most well written, enthralling story I've personally ever experienced, the characters and original voice acting are completely perfect and the music and monster design are incredible,
                even iconic. Even though the gameplay is lacking in some parts, it's a product of its time and, in a lot of circumstances, the sluggishness of the combat does add something to the experience. It's been my overall
                favorite game for a long time, it's a masterpiece.</p>
                <h3>Undertale/Deltarune</h3>
                <p>Two separate games from the same creator, both incredible.There's a reason why everyone went crazy when Undertale came out, it's such a well-written, enjoyable story that's elevated 
                to great heights thanks to its fun gameplay, snappy music, great characters and, most important of all, consequences of one's actions. It's by far the best example of a game with diverse experiences based on 
                player choice, nothing comes close to it. Although I prefer Undertale's story, Deltarune has more engaging gameplay for me and it's not even halfway completed yet. Once it is, it might surpass its predecessor.</p>
                <h3>Your turn to die -Death Game By Majority-</h3>
                <p>My favorite story genre has been Death Games for quite some time, and although there are many games out there that follow this format and have better game elements, 
                this small indie game is by far the most immersive and well-written one. It's made me feel so many emotions in such a short amount of time as no other game ever has, and it's my number one recommendation of 
                the genre. The cast of characters, the most important element in these stories, is absolutely perfect, and the game forces some pretty heart-wrenching choices upon the player. Even if story-driven, point-and-click
                games aren't your cup of tea, I wholeheartedly recommend giving this one a try.</p>
